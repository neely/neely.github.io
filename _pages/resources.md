Videos:

[Brett Phinney UC Davis Proteomics Online 2d Short Course](https://video.ucdavis.edu/playlist/details/0_4jkc4swu) - I did one of these btw

[Other Brett videos](https://video.ucdavis.edu/channel/UC+Davis+Proteomics/316022232)

[David Tabb](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidTabb/playlists) - often have slides in comments, ex. [proteomics for clinical biomarkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gs34jgmLOo)

[Matt Padula](https://www.youtube.com/@MatthewPadula/featured) - all things mass spec and proteomics

[May Institute](https://www.youtube.com/@MayInstituteNEU) - Stats!

[Mass Spec Everything w/Ben Katz](https://www.youtube.com/c/MyMassSpecWorld)

Blogs (proteomics):

Orsburn blog (check out "Useful Stuff!" sidebar - https://proteomicsnews.blogspot.com/

Phil Wilmarth blog/repo - it is both, but you can read blog here https://pwilmart.github.io/blog/ and navigate repo here https://github.com/pwilmart/Start_Here. There are tutorials, vignettes, and slide decks throughout. For re-analysis I recommend the LFQ re-analysis of my sea lion urine data (https://github.com/pwilmart/Sea_lion_urine_SpC), and the re-analysis of Beynon data https://github.com/pwilmart/Mammalian_sperm_PXD003164.

Ron Beavis website with all sorts of things (https://www.somecrazyblogger.org/a/index), specifically his unofficialy dataset annotation https://www.somecrazyblogger.org/a/tweets?s=pxd
