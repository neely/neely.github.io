This site is a collection of posts that are very informal, with myself as the target audience. Opinions expressed are solely my own.

The name of this site is "Notes from the Edge". which is the edge of the interwebs, sometimes the edge of the envelope, from me on James Island, SC near the Edge of America, Folly Beach, SC, and maybe at times from the edge of insanity. The general theme and goals are mentioned in [the inaugural post](posts/2020-05-11-hello-world.md).
