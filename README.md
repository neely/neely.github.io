This is my personal blog on science, its history and ethics, in particular research integrity. The blog is hosted on GitHub Pages and based on the beautifully simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) by [Amit Merchant](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990).
