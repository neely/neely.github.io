[Hello World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) This is my first post on this blog, a blog which will cover any topic of science, history of science or research integrity I find interesting. While I like the platform and try to be as active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MagnusPalmblad) as time permits, I sometimes find myself wanting to expand an argument, providing additional background or reasoning. I am not a fan of creating long, clumsy Twitter threads. Nor does every argument deserve an opinion piece in a scientific journal. Therefore, I am creating this blog with the intention to publish at least one major post at the end of every month, with minor updates every week. The blog may also feature occasional guest bloggers and links to other blogs.

For those interested in the technical details, the blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and based on the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme, which itself is a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
