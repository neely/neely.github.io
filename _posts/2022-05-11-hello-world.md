This is the official start of what could be termed a blog, that sometimes is long. These posts will be akin to the [News in Proteomics Research](http://proteomicsnews.blogspot.com/) that initially was a public note keeping system, and pretty much still is. Similarly, this blog is a way for me to keep track of discussions I enjoyed on Twitter (or elsewhere online) and sometimes add thoughts or references. I promise typos and likely edits and re-edits.

Unless you have been living under a rock, you know that since at least 2018, Twitter has been the the place for excellent discussions on mass spectrometry, proteomics, bioinformatics and statistics. #TeamMassSpec has quite the showing there, but other domains are also well represented. This has led to the casual discourse you might have at a conference, but these conversations are public for all to hear. I won't lie, SciTwitter has been amazing to me. I can ask dumb questions all day long and the real experts show up to help me out. Also, this has allowed me to get to know more people in the field that I otherwise wouldn't be bumping into in Charleston, or even at many conferences.

I will try and post companion posts near the time they are discussed, but I have a backlog of topics including isotopes, proteasome, proteostasis, weird identification in a bat DIA dataset use case, single-molecule detection, various papers, various polls, complement, SEPT and MARCH, Phil Wilmarth's evergreen database thoughts, POTRH, and human ethics on public proteomic data.
