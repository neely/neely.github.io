excerpt: With Twitter changing hands, many users are contemplating (or have already ) left SciTwitter for Mastodon.

The last couple weeks have seen tremendous upheaval on Twitter as Elon Musk has taken the helm. Some users have left out of principle (i.e., issues with Elon Musk), but [certain/abundant missteps](https://twitter.com/christapeterso/status/1592317592966168576?s=20&t=48fKAx9eQ9G3x0__XmnLEA) have caused legitimate worries about whether Musk could break Twitter.

Personally, I don’t see reasons to jump ship immediately ([my thoughts](https://twitter.com/neely615/status/1590329563414159361?s=20&t=Lgv2-j8ElmhsPf3-PKOvZA)), but I did want to go and look at Mastodon (the main [exodus destination](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/numerous-social-apps-see-gains-in-wake-of-twitter-chaos-new-data-shows/)), and so have compiled some notes/links.

- [What is a Mastodon?](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/what-is-mastodon/)
- Picking a server (aka instance) is your first choice, but you can use [Debirdify](https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/) to see where your Twitter followers and follows have gone.
- Cris Lapthorn has a running [list of what servers/instance people have moved to](https://twitter.com/makingions/status/1590160421931352064?s=20&t=Lgv2-j8ElmhsPf3-PKOvZA), though Debirdify can capture this as well.

- [Understanding “Home”, “Local”, and “Federated” timelines.](https://queer.party/@cassolotl/108195007013414698)
- [How to “DM” on Mastodon (cause it isn’t quite the same).]( https://gizmodo.com/mastodon-how-to-dm-send-messages-twitter-1849759852)
- How to save the SciTwitter network using [OpenCheck](https://opencheck.is/scitwitter)?

Most of my casual research has centered on making Mastodon more like SciTwitter, which is probably missing the point and the potential of Mastodon. Overall, using hashtags is very important (#teamProteome is my new fav), and there was something about using a.gup.pe group ((@MassSpec@a.gup.pe)[https://a.gup.pe/u/massspec]), though I can't seem to find the tweet that announced this. Both hashtags and groups can help collate toots into your timeline. I do see some benefits for having a teamProteome specific server (i.e., have a super nerdy Local timeline without needing to follow everyone on your server), but also, for me personally, I think communicating outside of teamProteome is critical. Also, for me at least, I appreciate how I get science and life in one place on Twitter (weather, local stuff, cycling, etc.) and when those things move it will make my Mastodon timeline closer to what I want.
