title:  The magic of Bluesky
categories: [social media, Twitter, SciTwitter, ProteomicSky, TeamMassSpec]
excerpt: I think today may be the day for Bluesky to finally be the replacement for SciTwitter. It has the right pieces and may actually have people.

Last fall I wrote about what was going on with the initial Twitter exodus, and tried to present a [primer on Mastodon](https://neely.github.io/MarchToMastodon/). Since then many did in fact leave Twitter for good and are only on Mastodon. For whatever reason, these are some of my favorite computational folks (Phil Wilmarth, David Tabb, etc.). Bluesky has slowly been building in invite-only mode, but for me has never been more than some of my favorite authors (Neil Gaiman and John Scalzi) posts... but this past week I started to see a lot of the genomics comp bio folks posting on BluieSky, and then even more yesterday and today. Maybe it was that [Elon just said Twitter might charge everyone](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/18/elon-musk-says-x-will-charge-users-a-small-monthly-payment-to-use-its-service/), but something seemed to happen.

So here is my effort to again present what I know and like about BlueSky, and what they present as their future plans (not exhaustive):
- [Algorithm Choice with Custom Feeds](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds) and [another](https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-now-lets-you-choose-your-own-algorithm-183824105.html)
- [BlueSky for Scientists](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aPddaH-d7N53jZm1S3vUrfjVVy5nykPQz6qd7QpPCQE/edit#heading=h.58mkl21vxs3m) - this has a tool to scrape your twitter follows and get them into BlueSky
- [Vox article on Bluesky](https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/29/23702979/bluesky-twitter-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-chrissy-teigen-aoc-dril-decentralized)
- [BlueSky's Business Plan](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan)

For me, it clicked today when I made a custom proteomics feed using the skyfeed.app (instructions [here](https://bsky.app/profile/markrubin.bsky.social/post/3k7bn2bbkmr2s)) and realized that by pinning it I can have multiple feeds to click through at the top of the webUI or the app. Why is this a big deal for me? I thought (and still think) Mastodon is awesome and has all the right things going on... except being able to browse your follows when time is limited ([a thread by me about this](https://x.com/neely615/status/1683599480229068801?s=20)). Let's say all 2-3k team mass spec folks come over to Mastodon, and here I am browsing a chronologically sorted timeline... I am gonng miss tons of posts unless I have hours to scroll and will be biased towards those active when I am active (like a shared time zone or region). Instead, with BlueSky I can make up whatever feed I want that can gather certain users or tags (even emjoi), mixing in random posts from all over, picking the last 3o minutes or day or 3 days or 7 days, or I can sort it all based on likes, chronologically, random, or Hackter News Rank (whatever that means). Specifically, it means I can (and did) make a ProteomicSky feed and now I can see others *are* actually here and I can quickly browse it. Obviously I need to fine tune this custom feed (maybe make a "hot" ProteomicSky feed instead), but that's the thing, I can make whatever I want or anyone else can. This is not a choice in Mastodon (short of maybe the app Mammoth starting to add it).

Feed Update: [ProteomicSky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gl7bvz3uo4ym2fnmvgkjzeb3/feed/aaakx5my5bkl2) is chronological and [ProteomicSky-Hot](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gl7bvz3uo4ym2fnmvgkjzeb3/feed/aaalgayjgixrs) is last 24 h sorted by likes (may adjust to 3 days).


Okay, but going back to my post last year, what was the function of sciTwitter and what are we getting right/wrong.
- Posts are not public (yet), so public SciComm sharing doesn't work (yet)
- AltMetric isn't here (but it isn't anywhere but Twitter, yet)
- Many of my nonScience follows (think cycling, weather, sports) are on X or Threads, but not here (this is still a big bummer to me about the whole twitter exodus)
- There is no Bluesky DM
- There is some promising options for feeds and I think just maybe folks will migrate
- No Spaces thingy, but POTRH has some plans if needed (Discord I think)
- Will I be able to access everything via an "AllMyTweets" type service?
- I *can* view all my follows without worrying about servers or truncated conversation threads (looking at you Mastodon)
- Having custom feeds to flip through on the app or webUI is a really fun hack I didn't think I would like as much as I do ([here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tJw1r_Dif9AN6lVNNaZ-nwDdbM7tPemobo5_S2aEl_U/edit) are more science ones)


I may add more here later.
